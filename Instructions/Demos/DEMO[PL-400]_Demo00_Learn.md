# Demo 0 - Microsoft Learn

**Objective:** In this demo, you will explain how to use Microsoft Learn.

Students need to create an account on Learn. As an MCT you need your students to have a Learn account and to redeem the achievement code at the end of the course to track that you have delivered this course. This is important to you for renewing your MCT and to the training services provider to meet their obligations to Microsoft.

All courseware is on Microsoft Learn. Students need to create a profile if they do not have one.

## Task 0.1 - Learn profile

1. Walk students through signing into Learn <https://learn.microsoft.com>
