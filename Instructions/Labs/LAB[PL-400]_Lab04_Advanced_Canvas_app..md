# Practice Lab 4 â€“  Advanced canvas app techniques

## Scenario

As we continue to build our solution, we will now customize the canvas app to use variables and the Patch formula.

## High-level lab steps

We will follow the below basic steps to optimize the canvas app:

- Add variables to store the user's Office 365 profile.
- Use Patch to set the status reason of an inspection to failed.

## Things to consider before you begin

- Should you use OnStart or OnVisible?
- What do you need to update a record using Patch?

## Starter solution

A starter solution file for this lab can be found in the  C:\Labfiles\L04\Starter folder.

## Completed solution

Completed solution files for this lab can be found in the  C:\Labfiles\L04\Completed folder.
